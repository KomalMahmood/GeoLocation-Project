# GeoLocation-Project
  This project gives you the current location of the user 
  Two methods are used 
 (1: navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition that gives you current location of user only once and 2: geolocation.getCurrentPosition that gives current location 
 of user but also keeps updating it as user moves like a GPS)
